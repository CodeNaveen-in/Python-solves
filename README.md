# Python solves

Welcome to my Python learning repository! 

This repository is a collection of mini Python projects and scripts that I've created as I've learned the language. It's organized by domain, making it easy to find examples and projects related to specific areas of Python development.

## Structure

The repository is structured into the following subfolders:

* **`games/`**: Contains Python games, from simple text-based games to more complex ones using libraries like Pygame.
* **`tools_set/`**: Includes utility scripts and tools that automate tasks or provide useful functionality.
* **`web_development/`**: Houses projects related to web development using frameworks like Flask and Django, as well as scripts for interacting with web APIs.
* **`data_analysis/`**: Contains scripts for analyzing and visualizing data using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.
* **`scripting/`**: Includes general-purpose scripts for system automation, file manipulation, and other scripting tasks.
* **`algorithms/`**: Implementations of various algorithms and data structures, serving as a learning resource for fundamental computer science concepts.
* **`gui_applications/`**: Projects that demonstrate GUI development using libraries like Tkinter and PyQt.
* **`machine_learning/`**: In the future this folder will contain projects related to machine learning using scikit-learn and TensorFlow. (Some basic projects only)

## Getting Started

To run the scripts in this repository, you'll need Python installed on your system. It's also recommended to use virtual environments to manage dependencies.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x (recommended)
* `venv` (usually included with Python)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository name]
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    * **On macOS and Linux:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    * **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies (if any):**

    Some projects may require additional libraries. You can install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt #If a requirements.txt file exists.
    #or
    pip install library_name #installing a specific library
    ```

5.  **Run the scripts:**

    Navigate to the relevant subfolder and run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python filename.py
    ```
